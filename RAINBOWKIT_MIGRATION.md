- **Faster Connection**: Streamlined wallet connection process
- **Better UX**: Modern, responsive wallet connection interface
- **More Wallets**: Support for all major wallets through RainbowKit
- **No Authentication Barriers**: Users can explore the platform without wallet connection

### For Product Development
- **Easier Testing**: No complex authentication setup required
- **Faster Iteration**: Focus on core features instead of wallet complexity
- **Better Scalability**: RainbowKit handles wallet updates automatically
- **Reduced Bugs**: Fewer authentication-related issues

## Current Status
- ✅ Migration complete
